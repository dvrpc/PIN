Philadelphia Inquirer Neighborhoods -
Based on James Smart's Philadelphia Neighborhoods maps (June, 1988), these data layers comprise the "widely known neighborhoods" and "lesser known neighborhoods" whose names "may be used in copy without further explanation, on the presumption that most Philadelphia residents are familiar with their location."

It is important to note that the areas contained in these layers were not drawn from a base map, rather from street borders. Some of these "lesser known neighborhoods" have been excluded, simply because the borders were too vague to draw (e.g. "THE NECK - Once the entire lower part of South Philadelphia, later the lower east side of South Philadelphia, particularly around Second Street. Old-timers still use the name.")

This web mapping application was built by the [Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission](https://www.dvrpc.org/)for the Philadelphia Inquirer. Please contact Chris Pollard, GIS Manager @DVRPC for further information.
